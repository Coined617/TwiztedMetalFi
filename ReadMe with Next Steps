# Twizted Metal ZK DeFi

A privacy-preserving DeFi game dApp with anonymous ZK ID, built with Anchor (Rust), Circom, and React, deployable on GitHub Pages.

## Structure
- `anchor/` — Solana Anchor smart contracts
- `circom/` — ZK identity circuits
- `frontend/` — React frontend (for GitHub Pages)

## Next Steps
1. Implement Anchor game/DeFi logic and ZK identity verification
2. Build out Circom circuit for ZK identity
3. Integrate zkSNARK proof generation on frontend
4. Connect frontend to Anchor via wallet and ZK proof
